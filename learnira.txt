>Mission: Our mission is to provide quality education for the African child.

>Vision: To be the no 1 online learning platform in africa.

# The website will provide the following
  i. Video + excersies
  ii. peer learning i.e. interactivity
  iii. Reward
  iv. Performance measurement for any learner

But in the future one of our milestone will be;
** To involve machine learning to determine where a student should start learning when they come to the website; Don't worry abou this I will explain when we see. **
Now, apart from the web design which we expect soonest, If u need us to employ somebody who is just going to be an employee to work with you in the development of the ii-iv then let me know fast

Real teaching is the analog act of taking someone by the hand and exploring a topic together. What makes a good teacher isn’t an encyclopedic knowledge of a topic. It’s the wisdom to use just enough of your knowledge to make the journey together interesting.- Steven Ward

At first we considered letting the pedestrians define the walkways(sivers.org/walkways) by structuring the forum around how people actually used it. This approach has worked well for Gitter, Medium, Reddit, and Facebook, where feedback from our campers and usage statistics have driven virtually every design decision we’ve made.

Labour of life-time and delibrative practice.

"the most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an appropriate difficulty level for the particular individual, informative feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections of errors." (p. 20-21) The book Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics, and Culture in Everyday Life is an interesting reference for this viewpoint.

Anton Ego, says: "Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere."
